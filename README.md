Alpha-Host Server Files and Bot Files

This Bot is used to interact with the Pterodactyl Panel API and let the Users create and manage Servers and Accounts on their own. It also includes a currency System with a Server-Shop

The Bot Files will be kept Closed-Source until the TODO List has been completed.
There is not ETA. 
For Questions either open a Github Issue or Message me on Discord *Einkornwolf#1506*
